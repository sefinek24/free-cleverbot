This module enables developers to interact with the Cleverbot [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) without requiring an official API key, offering a convenient and cost-effective solution for integrating Cleverbot chatbot capabilities into your projects.


## üîí Security
The module selects a [User Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) randomly from an [array](https://github.com/sefinek24/free-cleverbot/blob/d17c9e8b5ec594bd26b3faa497897ad2e706b47c/scripts/useragent.js#L2) and uses it to send requests to `cleverbot.com`.
Each restart of the application results in the selection of a different user agent at random.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
**Using this module could potentially lead to a permanent [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) ban on [cleverbot.com](https://www.cleverbot.com), although this is unlikely.**

This module provides free access to Cleverbot's API, but it is crucial to use it responsibly, keeping in mind that Cleverbot.com may act against IP addresses that misuse their service.
Therefore, consider the following guidelines:
- **Use Responsibly**: Avoid excessive requests to Cleverbot in a short period. Adhere to their terms of service.
- **Testing and Development**: Ideal for testing and development purposes. Not recommended for high-traffic or production applications to prevent IP bans.
- **Use at Your Own Risk**: Users assume responsibility for any potential consequences, including IP bans or other actions by Cleverbot.com.
- **Consider Official API Key**: For extensive and commercial use, consider obtaining an official API key from Cleverbot for reliable and uninterrupted access.

We advocate for responsible usage of this module and respect for Cleverbot's service.
