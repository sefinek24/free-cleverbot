# ðŸ¤– Cleverbot Conversation Flow Documentation
This document provides an explanation of the symbols used to denote message direction in the Cleverbot conversation flow within the `async.js` and `promise.js` scripts.

## Symbols ðŸš¥
In these scripts, two symbols are used to clearly indicate the direction of the conversation:

- `->` ðŸ¡º (Arrow Right): Represents a response from Cleverbot. When this symbol precedes a text, it indicates that the text following it is a response provided by Cleverbot in the conversation.
- `<-` ðŸ¡¸ (Arrow Left): Denotes a user's message to Cleverbot. Any text following this symbol is a message sent by the user (or by the system acting as the user) to Cleverbot.

These symbols help in understanding and visualizing the flow of conversation between the user and Cleverbot, making it easier to follow and debug the interaction process.

## Example output ðŸ“ƒ
